# Planetary Temperature Control (PTC)

**Optimizing climate interventions for a sustainable future.**

## Overview

Planetary Temperature Control (PTC) is the brain behind climate interventions, ensuring optimal deployment of solutions to combat climate change. Our platform serves as the tactical operations system that makes planetary cooling possible by providing real-time data, optimization algorithms, and coordination capabilities for climate intervention operators.

**Core Value Proposition**: We are building the "command center" that tells climate operators where, when, and how much to deploy their interventions for maximum planetary cooling impact.

## Problem Statement

Climate interventions today happen in silos. Companies like Charm Industrial optimize for bio-oil, Climeworks for DAC, and Running Tide for kelp, but nobody is orchestrating them together. This lack of coordination leads to:

- Inefficient deployment strategies
- Suboptimal location selection
- Wasted resources and missed opportunities
- Limited visibility into intervention effectiveness
- Manual data collection taking hundreds of hours

## Solution

PTC provides a comprehensive climate intervention coordination platform that:

- **Optimizes deployment locations** using satellite data and geospatial algorithms
- **Provides real-time recommendations** on timing and scale of interventions
- **Coordinates multiple operators** to maximize synergies and avoid conflicts
- **Tracks intervention effectiveness** with continuous monitoring
- **Automates data collection** from multiple sources and formats

## Key Features

### **Geospatial Intelligence**
- Real-time satellite data integration (NASA, Copernicus, NOAA)
- PostGIS-powered geographic optimization
- Climate modeling and impact prediction
- Multi-region deployment analysis

### **Smart Optimization Engine**
- Machine learning algorithms for site selection
- Cost-effectiveness modeling
- Climate impact forecasting
- Cross-intervention synergy detection

### **Mission Control Dashboard**

- Real-time deployment tracking
- Performance analytics and reporting
- Collaborative planning tools

### **Data Integration Hub**
- Automated data collection from utility providers
- Multi-format data normalization
- API integrations with existing climate platforms
- Secure data sharing across organizations

## Technology Stack
